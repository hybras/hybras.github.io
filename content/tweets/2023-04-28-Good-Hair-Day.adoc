A girl complimented my hair today. I was out with my fwb in the library.

A _girl_ complimented my hair.
A girl complimented _my_ hair.
A girl complimented my _hair_.

I received a drive by compliment.
It was from the kind of person who's opinion I value (about such things).
They took time to pay attention to me.
And of all things, they observed one of the things about me I'm most self conscious about.

Wow.
