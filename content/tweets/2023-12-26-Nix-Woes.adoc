I updated the nixpkgs input in one of my flakes from 23.05 to 23.11, and one of the packages I was using broke!
What the hell?
I knew this was a somewhat common occurrence in Nix.
Leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
This would never happen in debian.

Probably because debian wouldn't even accept the package.
