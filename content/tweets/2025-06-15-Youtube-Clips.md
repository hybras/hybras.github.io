I'll get sucked into a youtube algorithmic doom spiral, where I'll keep watching clips of some movie or tv show.
Or the algorithm will keep recommending the clips for days or weeks.
By the end, I'll have a decent understanding of the show / movie.
Its very brainrot, but has helped me get into shows before  so I guess it counts as good advertising?
Most of the time I do hate how the clips are cut, or that they aren't long enough.

Apparently this is a common experience? I ran into a few others at work and Pride who echoed this sentiment.
