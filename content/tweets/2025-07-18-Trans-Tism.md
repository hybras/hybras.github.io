I love corporate America!
I love working.

My VP (corporate lingo warning) is a trans woman.
She told me my more senior colleagues spoke negatively of me during performance review (where I am ranked in comparison to everyone else).
Apparently my opinionated nature comes across as harsh.
I knew others' felt this way, but didn't realize the magnitude of it, for it to be a concern.

This was a gut punch for me, being told my personality (which I consider an aspect of my gender (expression)) is not viewed poorly at work.
At least I'm have a psych assessment soon.
Am i neurodivergent? Someone else?
Found out next time on Varun Chari!
