In middle school (8th? grade) health, we had a super nonchalant teacher. 
Someone was joking about how I had brains but no brawn. 
I don't know how, but somehow I was challenged to rip a piece of paper to prove my strength. 

In a supreme display of idiocy, I applied exactly the right amount of force. But, the paper was one that fit into a binder, and so the edge was reinforced with plastic. I didn't rip the paper.

I think everyone understood what happened after a few seconds. In the moment I was like "Are you fucking kidding me".
