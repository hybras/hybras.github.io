My mom said her sister is a bad driver. I disagree. I think that is average (by Indian standards). Still bad, but not intolerably so.

My Chithee (aunt) drives an suv since her household has 6 people. Idk why she didn't chose a minivan. The vehicles size definitely exacerbates things, but I think anyone in her shoes would run into the same problems. Driving in india is bad.

I rode a taxi back to the airport. The taxi driver, now he was bad. Casually Honking way more than everyone else, trying to fit his average vehicle in every crack,footnote:[by india standards, cars are smaller there and small vehicles like autos and motorcycles are more common] changing lanes. So annoying.
