[A Living wage](https://livingwage.mit.edu/) is about $30 in major US metro areas. Lets do some example math for tipping a waiter.

Oh shit.
None of my math is correct because min wage = tips + tipped wage. I was assuming that living wage = min wage + tips, but its actually living wage = tips + more tips.
Holy fuck I'm so stupid.
