I was walking back from the grocery store and saw a "weird" woman.
Her gait was a little odd, and her hair was not quite a normal hairstyle.
It's wrong to glance at a stranger and just label them.
But still I categorized her and felt a little kinship.

We kept dodging each other until it became clear we were both heading to the same place.
She explained in a breathy/hoarse voice that she was visiting family and we rode up the elevator together.
