I went to https://www.rajakelkarmuseum.org[Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum]. Great place. Cheap, lots to see.

This was the first time I saw Indian culture displayed (not performed) for Indians. You could get very close to lots of stuff, nothing had a "safety radius" to stand behind. My mom and Aunt sang / prayed. I ... felt _something_.

Totally convinced me that Western museums need to return stuff back to the rest of the world. Its sad that nothing in the museum was from before 1600 / pre colonial times.
