The quality of macOS spotlight search has declined.
I keep receiving suggestions for websites, or menus within Settings.

My muscle memory is interfering.
I search up "Cal" (for calendar), but instead get calculator as the top result.
Because its "predictive", it now thinks I want calculator now every time I search "Cal".
This is despite my usage history.

Is no way to modify search results?
