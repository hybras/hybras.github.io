I've heard this term for _years_ ("I'm playing vidya") without knowing its just a joke.
I only found this out in college (junior? year I think, lets say 2022).
Vidya is an Indian name, and american pop culture does occasional reference Indian / Asian stuff (I love avatar).
I assumed there was a video game called Vidya.
It wasn't till I eventually googled it (Why is Vidya so popular? Indian stuff isn't _that_ mainstream??)
