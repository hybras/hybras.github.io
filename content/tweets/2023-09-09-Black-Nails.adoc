Black women keep noticing my nails.

I'd say its a new woman every few months, say about a dozen women over the last few years. When I enter a black space I'm guarenteed attention.

I love the attention, I love showing off. 

But why them?
Google gives a lot of results for how much effort black women devote towards their hair and nails. I don't know about hair, but I've noticed black women wear nail art and acrylics more frequently.
