I was curious about how much desktop's cost from various sellers, since I'm interested in building/buying one.
Google returned Apple's India catalog while searching, so I peeked.

A mac mini costs $600 in the US, and ~$750 in India.
How is this possible?
Aren't many of the parts made in China?
Aren't the parts assembled in China?
Surely it isn't due to the cost of shipping? (India is close by).

The median income in India is far far lower.
Who is apple selling its products too?
