Just figured out how to use a hair brush after watching a tiktok video (on reddit of course) about sisterhood.
A young woman is crying in the bathroom and various women help her fix her appearance and provide emotional support.

Anyways, in the video an older women is brushing the subject's hair (which was stick straight and down to her butt)
I noticed the brusher did not drag the brush straight down, neither from the roots nor in segments starting from the ends and working their way up.
She had a rocking motion that seemed to glance off the person's hair.

I tried it and it worked.
I did have to tease my hair a bit, and it made me look very poofy, especially the hair on my crown.
But by the end I was able to drag a hairbrush unimpeded fully through my hair.
