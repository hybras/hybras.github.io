These past few years, I've really enjoyed sampling / eating raw ingredients (sometimes also lightly roasted and with salt).

I've liked

* onion
** green onion
*** the goop inside green onion
** the _sprout_ of a red onion. so strong / pungent
* chives
* ginger
* garlic
* tomatoes
* egg
* potatoes (boiled)
* cinnamon (powder and bark)
** i chewed the bark for like 20 minutes, it lasted so long
* saffron
* chickpeas (boiled, salted)
* olive oil
* jaggery
* cardamom
* mustard
** I was trying to replicate the experience of eating wasabi
* coriander (lots of crunching)

I didn't like / felt meh about

* nutmeg
* celery
* black pepper (tastes good on stuff)


Part of me wonders what the point of cooking is. /s

Indian food is all about flavor (spice capital baby), so simpler stuff really feels confusing (or bad).
