Sophomore year of college, I went shopping in Ikea.
There was a lamp I wanted that my mom wouldn't buy.
SHE didn't like it, despite it being on the cheaper side.
I waited for Junior year and bought it.
I still have it a year later and its so satisfying.
Unfortunately I dropped it a couple weeks ago so the lampshade is deformed.
