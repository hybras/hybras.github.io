I'm getting off the metro.
The janitor and I get on the elevator together.
He blasts a recap of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals[Caps] game.

[verse]
Him: You follow hockey?
Me: ...
Him: Soccer?
Me: I'm not really into sports
Him: Damn, I always wondered what my life would've turned out. I feel like sports is my everything.
Me: _Smiles sheepishly_
