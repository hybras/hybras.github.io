I made paneer yesterday with Trackim.
I tried to use a smoothie blender for the gravy, it was bad.
The blender was solely battery operated (couldn't be used while charging), had a weak motor, and was made of shoddy plastic (that couldn't handle hot liquids).

I ended up borrowing a blender from my neighbours across the hall.
I've heard their children playing through the wall, so I figured it would be safe to ask.
I gave them some paneer and roti as thanks, and they gave me Egyptian sweets to reciprocate.

Hooray for neighbours!
