Events on https://www.meetup.com/[meetup] and https://www.eventbrite.com/[eventbrite] are often crosslisted.

The two websites have such similar UI's (and their logo's are of similar color) that I didn't even realize I was on eventbrite instead of meetup.

I was looking for a meetup feature and couldn't find it.

I ended up googling what I wanted (on meetup), and only then realized I was previously on eventbrite.

https://kottke.org/[Kottke] also https://kottke.org/24/03/kottkeorg-redesigns-with-2024-vibes[redesigned his site] so have a similar appearance, all white and flat.
It looks good, I guess.
