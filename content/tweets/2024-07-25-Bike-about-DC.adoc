I've made a handful of major trips in the past 6 weeks on my bike, all from my current residence of northern Virginia (DC suburb/satellite go brr).

* College Park (from foggy bottom)
** Visiting friends on campus on Juneteenth. My company had the day off

* Alexandria
** Wanted to finish the southern segment of the Arlington loop, and see some of the Potomac.
** Felt a little isolating, being the seemingly only "alone" person out in public.

* National Harbor
** I'd visited MGM casino (ew) for a work trip, using public transport, and wanted to bike to the location. My bike was stolen, hadn't purchased a replacement at the time. But I saw some nice trails on the map
** Friends/Acquaintances wee going kayaking in the harbor, so I had an excuse to go
** Wanted to try the 495 bridge across the Potomac that connects PG County and Alexandria

I should start using strava, but that feels icky.
