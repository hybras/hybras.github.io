American Films about small town life are bad. Too focused on "small town pride".
Indian Films about small town life are good. They let people just be.

The same stereotypes about small minded, backwards people. But applied so differently.

Of course, women play a much smaller role in these films (Indian films are bad about women roles, small town films basically don't have women).
