This weekend I went to visit a friend.
However, a lot of people tried to reach out to me at once.

* Karthik did some apartment hunting. I booked tours.
* My Aunt reached out to me to catch up.
* Mo and Trackim invited me to their Super Bowl parties, but I couldn't attend.
* My friends Pramod and Matthew both had Super Bowl parties with their friends, I sadly had to pick one.
* A friend from UMD (Gayathri) reached out to hang.
* Ethan wanted to start chatting on Signal, an encrypted messaging app
* Rahul invited me to his birthday party.
* Earlier in the week, I randomly got dinner with Kusum.
* The week before, I got dinner with Russell and Ethan.
* This week I have a work party and an anime convention.

This is all very taxing.
