I bought a bottle of Limaca soda from a local grocery store. It was ok. I was like $1.50, so def worth it.

Its really nice being surrounded by so many brown people. There are so many brown stores and groceries with Fresh produce. Poojas, arangetrams, dances, concerts, temples, 

And when I'm tired of it all, I can just leave.
