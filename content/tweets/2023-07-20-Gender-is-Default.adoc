I went to visit an uncle. As an outing, he suggested to go suit shopping. I would get a tailored suit as a gift. I didn't have any better ideas (being new to the area), didn't want to come off as rude, and didn't want to out myself. In this situation, the male option was the path of least resistance. I don't think enough people appreciate that enough.

When I get my hair cut, I have be explicit about the length AND that I'm growing it out. Otherwise it'll either be cut short or cut uneven. I wish I had the balls to say "cut it like you would a woman's".

Later on, the uncle's sister made an offhand comment about a trans beggar, and how the beggar was probably lazy / taking advantage of their trans status.
