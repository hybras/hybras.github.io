I made guac for a "The Mandalorian" watch party last spring.
The focus seemed to be not on the content. They were all friends, and most didn't care about Star Wars (a couple people did!)
One night, they decided to have nachos for dinner.
I volunteered to make guac, since I wanted a vegetarian option.

My then-boyfriend/fwb (the one who introduced me to the group), arrived early at my apartment and helped me prepare the guac
