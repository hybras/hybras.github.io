I saw a YouTube thumbnail about the D.C. metro's "brutalist architecture".
It prompted me to share my opinion.

The first few times I rode the metro, I found the style jarring and soul crushing.
But I think that it was just shock.

Now as a regular rider, it feels comforting, bookending much of my travel (I do not own a car).
I wouldn't say I feel safe (alone), but I definitely wouldn't change the style.
Powerwashing some stations might be in order however.
