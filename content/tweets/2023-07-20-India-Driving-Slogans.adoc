I encountered many catchy slogans whilst traveling along Indian roadways (Maharashtra specifically). It was fun keeping an eye out for the signs, though I'm sure I missed a few.

* Drive wise, nobody dies
* Impatient on road, patient in hospital
* Speed thrills, speed kills
* Fast drive, last drive
* If married, divorce speed
