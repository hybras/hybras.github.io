I lost my local library card.
Not to worry, my library could renew / issue cards online!

I filled out an online form. Good to go right? Nope
It said (after I filled it out), that it would take 1-2 weeks to process.
I waited a week then purchased a library card in person.
They only took cash. I understand that the government cant rely on payment processors, but why does that mean cash only? Uggh. Thankfully I had someone else to cover the small fee.
Two weeks after I filled out the form I received a reply stating that I already had a card, with my username *and password* in plaintext. Thanks library üëç!
All this to discover the book I wanted was at a neighboring library and that I would have to wait a week to get it shipped.

I pirated the book.
