a week ago, my dad called asking if its ok for him and fam to come over this weekend (today). i was missing my brother so i said yes. i wake up today and get a text saying that they couldn't make it, due to the normal stuff they do every weekend. I'm so pissed for getting my hopes up, but heaven forbid I interrupt their routine.

My brother barely reaches out over text, and it makes me feel so unloved. W/o him Ive got no one. Its so hard to find a time when hes free, cuz hes constantly chatting with friends. Today he called. I was so surprised cuz usually I call first. It was really my mom. This is like the 4th time shes done this. I cut the call after a few mins. I tried to call my brother again but he didn't pick up. 

My friend has a car and drives back home. Last sem, he gave me rides. This was nice because I could go back on my own terms and see my brother w/o coordinating with my parents. This weekend he went home w/o telling me. All my friends knew he was going and was surprised I didn't go with him. I dont know how im supposed to explain this to him. Guilting my friend is wrong. But Amtrak is over a 100 round trip, I can't afford that. I'm def the choosing beggar here.

I tried to man up and call my parents to explain what assholes they were. I chickened out after 10-15 secs. My phone screen blacked out and I couldn't disconnect. My phone rang for over a minute, with me fumbling with it. my dad wouldn't pick up after bout a minute. I stood outside my room until he cut the call. 

I didn't think it was possible for my day to go so bad. i don't even see the point in continuing.
