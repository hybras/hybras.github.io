I was 6 when my brother was born.
I was super peeved about the fact that my mom was sick and tired from pregnancy all the time.
Then she was out to give birth.
Then she came back with this gremlin, was still sick and tired, and spent so much time taking care of him.
(Ayo what was my father doing? right, nothing).
I felt so left out when she went to pump / breastfeed that I kept asking to see.
Eventually mom caved once.
I remember feeling so disappointed.
You're telling me either a pump or my brother just sits there and sucks? For _hours_? Thats it!? (¿W body positivity?)

Anyways at some point the cuteness and familial relationship kicked in and I wanted to spend almost every second with him.
Mom was glad for some relief, though I'm sure I interfered more than helped.

So he got older (still super young) and starts developing his own personality and breh was I an asshole about it.
He copied me.
He clung to me.
He always wanted to be with me.
He slept with me / my mom.
He idolized me.
He loved me.

So I reacted my beating the crap out of him and humiliating him like nonstop.
Blaming him for stuff.
Hitting him.
Stealing from him.
Abandoning him.
Lying to him.

And of course he retaliated, but when can you do when you're half my size.

He got bigger, and older. Got harder (almost impossible) to push him around. Wasn't as fun anymore.
I started cashing in on the cuteness points full time.
Hugs.
Kisses.
Sleep time.
Cuddles.
He got big enough for _me_ to sit in _his_ lap.
I'd put my head on him, and he wouldn't care about me dandruff. Would just brush it off.

We were at a temple ad I was "grooming him", picking out dandruff and just moving his hair around. Random Lady asked if we were brothers.
At disney land we started hitting and fighting in a theatre. Random Lady asked if we were brothers.

Then he got even bigger and older and those things slowed to a trickle. Or stopped.
Biggest blow was when he started sleeping alone.
We were too big to share a kid bed, and I moved around while sleeping a lot.
One time we woke up on opposite sides of the bed. Loved how he just rolled with it.
Another time, he levelled up in karate and they gave him time to "go hug a parent". We all showed up and he couldn't decide on mom or dad, so he went with me. I can faintly remember everyone else gasps, oohs, and ahs when he did that. Easily one of the best days of my life.

I think he picked up on how brothers are "supposed to behave".
Of course my torment didn't help.
I wish I could go back to when he was like 7 and kiss his cheek.
Now he's all tough and cool and hard.
Loud.
Aggressive.
Sexist.
Out with friends all the time (one of these things is not like the other).
Got no time for little ol me (one of these things just isn't the same).

People catch our physical resemblance all the time (I don't always see it).
But no one thinks we have similar personalities.
He's a confident jock who lights up the room.
Multiple hs girls have told me hes hot/cute when I go back to visit.
I see the way his girl-friends (not girlfriend) treat him.
Even those who know we're related are shocked we are.
He's the one who turned out Right™️.
I'm not (too) salty about it.

Whatever, we love each other.
