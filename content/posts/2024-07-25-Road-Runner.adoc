== Trendy

From what I can tell, it is the current fashion for young upper middle class people to wear bulky running shoes.
Even for everyday wear.
_Sighs_
At least Hokas/Asics/New Balance/that cloud one look a little better than the even bulkier and clashing colors basketball shoes.
I really like some of the Hokas.

== In-person Visit

I went to Road Runner, since I need new sneakers.
They barely kept stock (many color options only had the display variant).
They also take you through this "shoe fit" program.
I feel this is a scam, went through a similar thing at a mattress store.
I'd much rather just try on all the shoes.
The salesperson has to bring you everything.
And my salesperson tried very hard to get a sale, asking me to do an online sale within the store.
Although I think that might have had more to do with my specific circumstance.
I said I'd take time to decide and order online at home.

The sales people were certainly knowledgeable.
They knew about the different traits of the shoes, and I overheard them talking amongst themselves about different brands and sales/releases they'd seen in years prior.
I hope they're paid sufficiently, they deserve it from what I heard.

== Online Order

Finally I tried to order online, only for my order to be declined multiple times.
I used fake contact info (why the hell do they need my email and phone), and they clearly noticed.
I called, and could tell the agent was trying to avoid telling me the order was marked fraudulent.

I walked to Designer Shoe Warehouse and purchased the most basic sneakers (but hey, slip-ons).

Fuck Hoka
