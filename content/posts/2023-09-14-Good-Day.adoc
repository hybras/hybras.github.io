I had another Good Dayâ„¢ today.

I woke up relatively well rested despite sleeping late.

I was productive first thing in the morning. I fixed the CI for my package repository. homebrew made it harder to update macos packages from linux, so I switched the OS. I made the CI run less frequently because macos costs more.

I made a really good omelette bagel for a late breakfast. I freshly picked and cut some green onion I grow. The seasoning (salt, black pepper) for my omelette came out well.

The rest of the day was lazy, studying AWS and catching up on my RSS feed. Slow, forward pace.

I didn't even realize what a great day I'd had till my brother asked me about my day. It was great!
