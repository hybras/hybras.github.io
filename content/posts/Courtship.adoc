Yesterday I went to hangout with a man I was interested in. He was in one of my math classes. We'd been hanging out before, but usually related to class. This was the first time we'd hung out without any pretext. I asked him if he was free sometime, and he asked me to come over _immediately_.

The "excuse" was that we were gonna watch football together. Flimsiest excuse ever given I was vocal about not liking football. Who even is Patrick Mahomes /s.

He offered some drinks, and we began talking. His red flags:

* He's obsessed with his ex (my friend)
** He thinks his ex hates him, when in reality my ex just wasn't into him
** He wants to know if his ex has "replaced" him. I refused to answer this question.
** He thinks he blew the relationship, when in reality the breakup didn't have much to do with him
** Post breakup, he said / did some troubling things to his ex.

* He drinks alot. Def averages 1-2 drinks a day
** Apparently he'd been drinking in the afternoon, well before I'd shown up
** He's mentioned his alcoholism before, but I assumed it was a joke / exaggerated (I struggle with his sarcasm)
** He mentioned he was only willing to open up to me because I was only willing to drink with him. He'd had another friend over, and was peeved when the other friend declined to drink.

* Racist towards brown people
** Couldn't go more than a few minutes without making a racist joke.

* Closeted
** Won't call himself gay/bi
** Won't associate with queer people
** I've never seen it, but apparently making homophobic jokes is part of his personality (his words, not mine)
** Only a small subset of friends know he's bi, due to him hanging out with his ex (my friend)
** Has a gay roommate (who's hot), and is still closeted.

* Mental Illness. I'm not a therapist, I can't diagnose him. He still fucked in the head.
** His process for determining who to associate with (mostly verbatim)
*** Have a set of ground rules for interacting
*** Observe and test someone
*** Confront them with the results
** He doesn't trust other people when they say they like him (tho tbf is it even possible to ask someone that?).
** He says no one really likes him, outside of his parents.
** Couldn't point out any signs of love from friends. He did say something about his parents.
** Seems insecure and lonely
** I opened up about my very similar feelings and experiences. I think I kinda got through, but I don't want to make sure.
