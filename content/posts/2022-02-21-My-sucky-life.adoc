I think about how sad and pathetic I am multiple times a week now.

I'm so fucking ugly.
I have so much acne, I'm skinny fat.
I've been working out for months now.
My friend are making noticeable gains but I'm stuck in the same place.
I can't bring myself to eat that much food every day. The thought of it makes me sick. The diner's food is so bad. And eating that much _meat_? I cant i cant cant.
My friend ordered a protein shaker cups for us, but I haven't ordered the protein powder. I feel awful for lying to him.

I'm so single.
I'm so tired of falling for straight guys.
It took me a few months to get over my friends.
I'm tired of drooling over good looking guys I see in person, even when I barely interact with them.
Swiping on apps is draining.
And I'm fairly certain its me thats the problem. Every so often I'll reduce my standards to see if its me, and I'll usually get more matches.
Its so painful seeing my friends start healthy relationships and have _so much fun_ with their partners.
Most of the people I know in relationships are attractive and it just drives home the idea that Ill never find someone good because why the hell would they be interested in _me_.
I read online about abusers, manipulators, liars and cheaters in relationships. These assholes get partners and I'm still single? Wow I must be _really_ undesirable.
No is ever gonna ask me out, let alone show interest.
I'm in a college campus and still can't get with someone.
Love and happiness are for other people.


No one wants to hang out with me.
Its always me tagging along with existing groups and them tolerating me.
When I eat lunch with Aman and Rus and weekends, they dominate the conversation. When its me and Aman, he barely talks.
Suhwan usually doesn't want to hang when its just us two.
Turner is engrossed in his math friends and girlfriend.

I can't get an internship.
I've barely applied.
I see everyone else getting positions.
I'm tired of applying and being rejected. Its such a fucking game.
I like what I study but work was so draining. My IEEE internship made me want to not code when I came home.

My own brother barely talks to me, even though I was by his side for most of his life. I love him so much and he never initiate conversation. It hurts so much knowing that he talks to his friends constantly and I have to beg for his attention.

It hurts so much seeing other people interact with their family. Even little thing like

My room is dirty and smelly. I barely shower and sleep.

Ive been thinking about cutting myself. I know its wrong but all I can think is how it seems better than anything happening to me.
I have nothing to offer to anyone.
I'm a terrible person, ugly, lazy, incompetent.
No one needs me or wants me.
