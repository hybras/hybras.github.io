My Mami, Vishnu Priya, is moving from Northern Virginia to Texas.
She will be taking her daughter, my niece, with her.
Her son, my nephew, will remain here with his father to finish high school.
She is in effect, separating from her husband.
I support her fully in her decision to move and find better opportunities for herself and her daughter.

Mami has been my rock here in DMV area for the last 4 years.
When I came to this area for college in 2021 (my freshmen year was remote due to covid), she welcomed me into her home with open arms.
The weekend trips, spending time with her family, and the home-cooked food, gave me the strength to continue in an new area.
I continued to visit her family after finding a job in the area, now for longer visits thanks to hybrid work.

She leaves next Monday and I will miss her very much.
