I just ghosted a friend group I've had for the last month. One of them is super annoying and targets me for being gay + socially awkward + sheltered. Its a joke about me every few minutes. The others never target me, but they almost never step in. 

One of them stood up for me a few days ago and that's when i realized that im the butt of most of the jokes. i was sharing something personal and the guy made fun of that. i went back to my room and cried. i decided ill try hanging out with them one more time after not hanging out with them for the weekend. i was sharing what i did and he made some joke about me that hed been preparing the whole weekend. id been there 10 mins

i hate that whenever u gather more than 3 straight guys they inevitably launch into sexist jokes. even if they're nice 90% of the time, there's always one guy whos an ass 100% and the nice guys and asshole are a package deal. this is the 4th time ive ditched a friend group since hs. i want straight guy friends and queer friends. but every time its been crash and burn and im just getting better at noticing the rudeness and leaving sooner. i can't keep doing this. im so ready to never leave my room again. 

the worst part is the nice guys that i love spending time with never learn, so they're almost as bad as the asshole. if i leave, it doesn't matter how much of a bond we had. they'll move on in 24 hrs to 1 week. ill be replaced, forgotten. the pain i feel is never reciprocated.

the guy apologized but i didn't believe it was genuine. i responded that i was still so hurt and insulted him back. now that some time has passed, i do believe the apology. i feel bad for insulting him. i want to be able to talk things out like adults instead of running away. im constantly second guessing myself. should i have said something sooner? can people change and i was too quick to judge? even though i feel hurt, i don't want to hurt him back.
