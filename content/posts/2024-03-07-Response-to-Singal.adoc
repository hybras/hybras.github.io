I read the first few paragraphs of "Temporary Celibacy As Avoidance” (not a subscriber, couldn’t read it all). I think my situation is somewhat similar. I didn’t sign up for an account because your comments section didn’t seem the most welcoming to trans people (regardless of your own views).

On the face of it, I think I fit your Trans Red Flags template: somewhat confused about my gender, heavily influenced by online discourse, other confounding mental health issues, not willing to admit reasonable discussion even with (most) family and friends. I especially identified with the “diktat” part.

(For me, at least), I think those red flags are all hogwash. Fuck Discussion. It isn’t my job to explain any part of my identity to anyone. My family will say I am lost and that they tried to understand. Technically, no abuse or cruelty occurred. And … that’s exactly why we’re estranged. In theory, there is room for reasonable discussion (for example, if someone is unfamiliar with trans people). But I’m not going to do the work to differentiate between bigotry and actual ignorance. The two are in bed with each other and I’m not untangling the web. Ultimately, it was all just another attempt to control me further and delay my self-expression. I’ve been living with my chosen identity for years at this point, and don’t regret a thing. I dictate these things, and those who show wanton ignorance are cut off.

A terrible analogy would be if I entered the basket weaving profession, and my family disapproved. They might ask my siblings abut their professions, and brag about them to their friends. But discussion about my work is generally off limits. They might, in a show of magnanimity, run a few google searches and declare they know all about how basket weavers like certain patterns. Or they might innocently ask why I like basket weaving so much, as opposed to accounting. None of this behavior is abusive or cruel. But for some people, this level of misunderstanding and tactlessness can only go on for so long.

For me, “The Missing Missing Reasons” added a lot of context to my experience. It's very difficult for some parents to admit they have failed to nurture their children’s emotional development, especially when they feel they have tried their best. 

I do not know much about the topics you are known for: youth gender health care and detransition. I am sharing my experience, not anyone else’s.

Best,
V.
