My brother and his friends went to see "Minions: Rise of Gru", and I chaperoned.
It was a meme for young men to go see the movie dressed in suits (yeah, I don't get).
I realized the possibility of "shenanigans" was high (dozens of teen boys doing a joke together), so I volunteered to watch my brother.

I sat away from my brother so I wouldn't "cramp his style".
Someone took my seat while I went to the bathroom.
I couldn't find my nachos, and I assumed my seat thief also stole them.
I told the occupant, but they waved me away.
Didn't even dignify me with a response
I sat in the closest empty seat.
Eventually someone came over and gave me my nachos??
Really confused by that.
I guess a group of people wanted to sit together, but they didn't mean to steal my seat?

My brother and his friends were fairly well behaved.
The various groups of teenagers didn't merge into a hive mind.
I only had to intervene once, when my brother and his friends were being a bit rowdy and taking up too much space on the sidewalk.

Movie was meh btw.
