A rough idea for a tv series

== Glossary -ish

|===
| Term | Definition

| Robots
| A robotic, cybernetic race of aliens. They are determined to conquer the galaxy.

| Drones
| The robot's mass produced dumb henchman / soldiers. Like B1 battle droids.

| Earth
| The first setting / planet, populated with humans. The name "Earth" was chosen for convenience. This is not the real earth, with the only intended similarity being that both earth's are where humanity is from.

|===

== Alien Robots

The species spends a _long_ time in "gestation" (having their parts assembled and consciousness imaged onto computers), but a very short time in "childhood" (knowledge is downloaded, and physical maturation rate depends on available resourced). They have internal power sources that last a while (nuclear??).

=== Abilities
. The species can hover
. transform into jets
. fire lasers from their hands and eyes
. communicate with computers and each other through the internet, They can be wired up for energy / data
. They can only heal minor wounds (cuts, scrapes). All else requires repair or replacement parts.
. configurable bodies (eyes on your feet, arms on your back), but deviations from standard body plan are rare. All parts can be swapped, including heads.

== Characters

|===
| Character | Description

| Main
| A 'defective' member of the alien race who has defected

| Child
| A child member of the alien race

| Leader
| Leader of the human rebellion

| Doc
| Rebellion's smart dude. He repairs Main

| Thanator
| Neighboring Conqueror

| Pix
| Alien who joins between last and penultimate seasons

== Plot

=== Prologue

. Main is assigned to conquer / administer earth
. He begins to observe human behavior
. He no longer wishes to conquer, growing apathetic
. The conqueror of the neighboring world is sent to kill him
. The human rebellion reanimates Main using spare parts.
. Main's survival is secret
. The robot's drones continue Earth's conquest a bit aimlessly

=== Season 1: The Rebirth of Main

Main is bitter about his defeat and injuries. He resents his disability and helps rebellion out of desire for vengeance.

==== Arc 1: Pilot / The rebellion

. The squad leads a mission to get vital supplies (something generic, like "power core") and intel.
. The sneak into facility, trigger security, get the thing, download communication data dump, harrowing escape
. Discover that a new robot is being dispatched to their world

==== Arc 2: The Child

. Child arrives on Earth. Marshals drones into cohesive fighting force
. Main is insulted that aliens sent a child
. Child grows suspicious that rebellion has a powerful soldier, but doesn't have much to report. Rebellions are common and standard protocol.
. Child's forces gaining advantage. Rebellion has last ditch effort to take Earth's central command, where Child operates from.
. Not wanting to reveal identity, squad takes child, Main takes drone forces.
. Child defeats squad with minor difficulty, but doesn't kill. He is focused on mysterious rebel taking on forces. Grows cocky, baits Main
. Main flies into silent rage, fights Child. Difficult battle, roughly evenly matched. Child recognizes Main as his predecessor (only Leader and Doc knew).
. Squad recovers and sees fight, realizes Main's identity. Leader and Doc aid Main.
. Child is defeated. Main seizes opportunity, brutally decapitates Child (to Squad's horror).
. Squad takes control, disables comm to offworld and teleporters
. Arc ends with Doc {transplanting, grafting} Child's { parts, body} to Main. Doc is reticent use a dead person's body. Main grimaces in pain as welding begins.

=== Season 2: The Neighbors

. Is only a matter of time before Robots' notice Earth's radio silence. Mostly likely outcome is neighboring Conqueror (Thanator, name is revealed now) sent again. His world and Earth are in the same system, and these planets are far from others.
. Squad decides to free neighboring world as well. Earth spends time recovering, then rebellion sends detachment to neighbors.
. Than notices approaching rebellion and shoots down most ships. Handful, including Squad, land and hide
. Squad learns about the Neighbors history and culture
. Than knows Squad is here, but doesn't know where. He chooses not to intervene because rebellion is still small.
. Child's head is brought along and reanimated for interrogation. Side arc about Child controlling nearby computers and almost revealing Main and him alive. Over this season Child forms a relationship with Squad and Neighbors (Squad figures out how to download info from Child anyways).
. Than puts 2 and 2 together, realizes Main is helping rebels. He intervenes with rebel mischief, brutalizes team. Than is much older / powerful than Main. Main puts up fight, but is killed. Than takes body for questioning / examination, learning mistake to check for death.
. Than is temporarily delayed in scraping Main's mind due to damage and modifications.
. Desperate, Squad decides last ditch plan to defeat Than. With neighbors' help, they create and hide nuke
. Child contacts Than, faking being kidnapped and giving location. Than decides to personally intervene again to save Child.
. Than finds neighbor / member of squad / suicide bomber. Goes like Donald's death from Invincible. Than tortures bomber, not realizing, bomber detonates. Millions of neighbors die due to it being a large city.
. Solemn team takes command center and finds Main's body, Damage is great. Doc decides to use Main's and Than's remains to make body for Child due to higher chance of success instead of reviving Main

=== Season 3: Going $HOME

. Battle weary Squad. Realize they now have _2_ planets worth of drones. Use to start large scale rebelliton, freeing other worlds, killing robots, and teleporting to next
. Also another alien has joined them, Pix. Has bolas that interfere with nervous system / cause paralysis and difficulty thinking the closer they are to your head.
. Child has swords that work like Penny's but look like Alucard's
. Child starting to have doubts about scope of rebellion in comparison to alien empire. Considering pausing rebellion to avoid the empire's problem of being spread too thin. Also has decrypted some of Main's memories but nothing useful. Scene of him "meditating" (considering strategies years in advance). Team member questions him, Child explains his views
. Team wonders about Child's new broodiness. They believe its impossible for robot personalities to change, and are worried
. Reduced importance of non - alien characters this season, sorry.

==== Arc 1: Memories

. Attack a world with _2_ alien conquerors. A brute with armor, and an intellectual with jammers / powerful transmitters
. Child makes a deal to use their data laser, used to access / repair damaged drives
. Child has incapacitating flashbacks, tricked and captures by duo
. Pix pretends to fight and get captured using own bolas
. Pix feigns interrogation, then deactivates bolas (their hers) and deactivates compounds security
. Team storms compound and frees Child
. Intellect notices Child escaping and tries to apprehend. Child throws him back into the main fight.
. Intel disables Childs swords and deflects laser blasts
. Pix is nearly as strong as Brute, but can't hurt him due to armor
. They swap foes. Pix uses bolas to paralyze / incapacitate Intellect. Brute smashes Child to the ground in overconfidence.
. Child lands like Penny in her final battle. And opens eyes brimming with a little electricity (like Harriet in RWBY v Ace fight 1). Blasts Brute with single shot.
. Intellectual's dying words "$HOME will defeat you". Pix kills Intellect
. Child reveals that Main also believed the only way to quickly end war to attack $HOME itself, and stop aliens from being born. Main also had questions about the origins of the Robot species

==== Arc 2: Returing $HOME

. Take portal from last setting to $HOME
. Arrive to find planet deserted. Security silently tripped.
. Kills one of the team, sends the other back and closes the portal. A robot easily defeats Child and Pix (huge, 4 arms), trapping them in "magnetic locks" (freezing and magnetizing them).
. Next Ep
. Giant reveals they are the only inhabitant of the planet. All other aliens have spread to other world. Begins plans to reprogram Pix / Child and repair them
. Learn that "childhood memories" are false / just programming. Robots are activated as they are deployed to worlds. There are a handful of "fetuses" in development, otherwise nothing else.
. Pix, Child wonder why Giant is so forthcoming. They reveal that memory wipe is part of reprogramming
. Team able to locate $HOME's location from view of stars
. Launch attack. Giant leaves automated reprogramming to defend planet
. Pix is freed, Giant returns to recapture her (there's automated defenses on the planet as well)
. Restrains Pix. Giant claims to have outmaneuvered Pix. Pix uses lasers to destroy prison compound / room where Child is kept
. Giant is confused. Child is unlikely to have survived. Child emerges from wreck, damaged but able to fight. Child reveals his power is hardware error correction ("pain tolerance"). Ability inherited from Main (Main acquired it due to patchwork body).
. Pix detects Central Computer. Unable to access. Child realizes he can access (also power from Main). Deactivates planet's defenses and Giant.
. Send message recalling all forces.
. Uncover message from "The Creators"

=== THE END
