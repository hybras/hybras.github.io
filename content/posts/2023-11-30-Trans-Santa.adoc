https://kottke.org/23/11/0043491-transanta-is-an-online-se[Jason Kottke] recommended a donation program that helps queer individuals.
I was excited to hear about it (me gay!).

I was surprised by the items people requested. They were largely all very normal things: clothing, decorations, toiletries.
Many of the aid services I know of try to address a specific need and ... treat their users a ... certain way. Think soup kitchens, dv shelters, reduced fair transit. In .. an Â¿_infantalizing_? way. 
I found myself judging why anyone would *need* items like plushies or stilettos, especially if they were down on their luck.
But the prices of such items were never unreasonable (and many items were things *I* want) so I surpressed my concerns.

Then I realized many individuals requested prepaid debit cards, in amounts well in excess of the other items.
Now my judgement came roaring back.
How could people request money?
I don't know if they'll use it wisely!
Some people justified it on their bios (food, emergencies), many didn't.
How do I know they _need_ it?

I consider myself a social justicey person.
Volunteering, fundraising, etc.
I've read research about how financial issues can be all consuming.
I've read stuff about how beneficial cash assistance can be (especially cash, not just limited things like food money).

Then I felt ashamed, because I could be one of those people.
I ended up buying items for a few people, but no prepaid cards.
