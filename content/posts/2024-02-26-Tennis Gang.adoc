[.line-through]#A few years ago# sometime around 8/9th grade, my dad signed me up for tennis lessons from a local "uncle" named Septimus / "Sep".

Sep was a part of a group of Asian tennis players who monopolized some of the town's courts from 6am to 9am in the summer.
My dad got up early to play and must've run into him.

So began my summer routine of getting up at [.line-through]#5# [.line-through]#5:30# 5:45 to take lessons from Sep.

It was brutal getting up that early (I was late / skipped about once a week). And I was very anxious about going (I'd been voluntold for this, and my dad was very strict about tennis and I didn't want a repeat of my dad).

Sep turnt out to be very chill.
He mostly kept to himself out of the gang.
I'd practice with him for 1-2 hours, and rally with the others in the final hour.
I was the youngest there, the other elderly ladies were friendly and always looking for people to swap in/out.

Sep couldn't run too much, so we didn't spend too much time rallying.
We very quickly formed a pattern of working on my serve.
My serve definitely need work
I found the focus inane, but at least he didn't make me miserable.

Looking back, I had poor form, and used hours of practice to ignore my incorrect muscle memory. Once I stopped practicing, that veneer disappeared and my muscle memory returned.
