I was out clubbing after a work event in DC yesterday.
I left my bike at a rack outside the bar.
I didn't lock it up because I forgot my bike lock key.
When I returned outside after a couple hours, my bike was gone.
I only have myself to blame.

What feels like a coincidence though, is that I also _just_ acquired another bike.
My university seems to have a circulating population of old bikes (they seem to b from 1960-1995).
These cycles are plain vehicles, not cheap garbage from walmart or fancy playtoys for wealthier people.
They get you from point a to b w/o fuss, have lasted for decades, and require a minimum of maintenance. 
I realize this may be survivors bias, but I really admire these bikes.
Chipped paint and a rusty chain is usually the worst of their problems, which is saying a lot after 30 years.

Often, these cycles will be abandoned after a minor problem.
I found an old blue schwinn traveler with a flat tire a few months ago.
A week ago I found an old yellow Atlas with rusted chain.
I took the Atlas in for repair and $200 later, I'm now heading in to pick it up.
It strikes me as ironic that I'm going to get a new bike (one older than me) immediately after losing one.
Though, this didn't happen when I got the schwinn.
The atlas isn't a solution to my stolen bike.
I'm going to take it for a joyride, then return it to the people of College Park.

So then what will I do for a new bike?
