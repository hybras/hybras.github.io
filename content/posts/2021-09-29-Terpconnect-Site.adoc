WARNING: When your making a website, it does not Just Workâ„¢. All filenames must be exact, all casing must be identical (FILE.JPG and file.jpg are not the same). Everything must be in the right place. Every opening tag/quote needs a closing one. You're used to software handling these things for you, that's ok.

It doesn't matter if your mac / win / lin.

== Make a folder

Make a folder *just for your site* You can call it whatever, and keep it wherever, but it should only have ur site's files inside.

== Download the files

When downloading the html files in chrome, u can right click on the page, click `view source`, and then hit `ctrl + s` \ `cmd + s`

. Main page: http://www.astro.umd.edu/~peel/ePortfolio/genericsplashpage.html -> Rename it to `index.html`
. Reflection Page: http://www.astro.umd.edu/~peel/ePortfolio/genericreflectionpage.html
. Styling: http://www.astro.umd.edu/~peel/ePortfolio/genericportfoliostyle.css


== Editing your site

NOTE: Editing and uploading are two separate, independent steps. Your site will look exactly the same no matter where it is.

You have 2 options. It roughly depends on whether ur a cs/ce/math major / how technical u r. 

. Downloading an editor and editing on your computer. 
.. Pro: work faster
.. Con: download an app you'll prolly never use again.
. Using an html editor website.
.. Pro: Download nothing
.. Con: More limited (usually only supports one page at a time), less features

=== Edit Locally

. Download an editor. Pick one. I use VS Code, but thats because I also use it for other stuff. You can other others
.. https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code]
.. https://www.sublimetext.com/[Sublime]
.. https://atom.io/[Atom]
. Open *The Folder* containing ur site in your editor. The folder. The folder. The folder

IMPORTANT: Splash page must be renamed to `index.html`. `index` is special. When you navigate to a folder in a web browser, the `index` page is served. if you imagine a file system as a tree, this means folders and files can both be web pages. If you don't rename it, people will have to remember the exact url to ur site, which is bad.

. Open the page ur editing in a browser (prefer chrome but idc). Reload whenever u make changes to it
. Format the page's source code (google "$MYEDITOR format document"). This indents stuff and makes it easier to read. 

=== Actually Editing

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption[captioning an image]
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color[CSS Colors]
** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool[Color picker]

Remember that most (pretty much all) html <tags> need to be opened and closed </tags>. 

== Uploading

* macOS finder can connect to terpconnect "Using your operating system")
* Everyone (including mac ppl) can use webdav ("Using a Web Browser
")
** Their guide says don't use chrome, ignore that its outdated
