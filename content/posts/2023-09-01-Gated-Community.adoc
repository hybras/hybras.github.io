I'm talking to my cousins grandmother (technically shes my aunt and the cousins are ... something, but whatever).

> I hate living in gated communities (in India). No neighborly feel. Can't say hi to people walking past. Can't say good night / good morning to my neighbors. Its the same here in America with the big houses.
