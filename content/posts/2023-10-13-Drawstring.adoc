I fixed the drawstring in the wasteband of my short! It was sucked in a few inches. I used bobbypins and hairclips to pull it back out.

The internet (and in particular, youtube) was useless. Everything suggested using hangers or sewing tools / techniques.

My mom threaded the drawstring for another pair of shorts with her bare hands.
