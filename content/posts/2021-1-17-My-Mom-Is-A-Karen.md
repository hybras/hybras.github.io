What comes to mind when you think "Karen"? A middle aged white woman? Someone making demands of those in service industry? Using stereotypes to justify reporting minority groups to the police? Except for not being white, my mom is a dead ringer for the all the other Karen™️ qualifications. I've always been embarrassed about my mom's behavior in public (lets be honest who *hasn't been embarrassed* by their family in public?). But a recent incident 😑 made me rethink whether my mom treats strangers with a similar level of respect to her family.

1. Incident @ Cake 🍰 Shop
   1. She highlighted to the stores **2** employees that the sign was not lit up. In the middle of the day
   2. Then went on to fake a concern that other people might not know if the store was open, and listed *every other store on the block that had their signs lit*, which wasn't even all of them (cherry-picking mom?).
2. Whenever we go out to eat
   1. She always orders *warm* water. No problems there.
   2. On the off chance the waiter serves 😠 room temp water my mom will glare at the waiter, refuse to drink it, and demands it be warmed.
   3. Ditto for minor mistakes in food delivery / groceries.
      1. Once we ordered red apples, and green ones were sent instead. Mind you, the apples were fine. My mother got a food refund after admonishing the business owner.
