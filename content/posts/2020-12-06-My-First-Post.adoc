== What is this?

This is a https://gohugo.io[hugo] site using the https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/[Beautiful Hugo].

== How's it going to far?

Hugo has too many config options ü§Ø.
However, the defaults seem excellent.
For example, I can use \( \KaTeX \).
I have my IDE set up to use autocomplete for emoji `:shortcodes:`.
Also, hugo is friggin fast ‚ùó
