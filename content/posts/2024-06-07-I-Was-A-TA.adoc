Last wednesday, I was speaking to a colleague who went to the same university as me.
It turned out I'd TA'd a class they took, and they went to office hours during my shift.

Yeah, you were like very unhelpful and that's how I knew you were smart.

I asked this question about recursion in assembly, and you said something like "Oh yeah, just look at the stack trace".

I basically didn't go to CS office hours after that.

I was floored hearing this.
I don't remember this at all, but it definitely seems like something I'd say/do, especially off-hand.

I'm ashamed I furthered the nerdy asshole stereotype.
I'm sure I thought I was being helpful, but clearly I wasn't.

I wonder if I do more harm then good in educational situations.
