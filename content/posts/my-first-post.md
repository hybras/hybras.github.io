## What is this?

This is a [hugo](https://gohugo.io) site using the [Beautiful Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/).

## How's it going to far?

Hugo has too many config options. :exploding_head: However, the defaults seem excellent. For example, I can use \\( \KaTeX \\). I have my IDE set up to use autocomplete for emoji `:shortcodes:`. Also, hugo is friggin fast :exclamation:

## What's left?

- [ ] Setup other themes
- [ ] Transfer posts from my github jekyll site.
- [ ] Enable other goldmark / features
- [ ] Learn more about Hugo
- [ ] Add my favicon
- [ ] And more!
