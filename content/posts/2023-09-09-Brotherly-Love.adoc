I love my brother. 

This is not an uncontroversial statement. Most people love their sibling.

But I am comfortable showing him a level of physical affection uncommon in western culture. Feminists talk about this, how men are discouraged from expressing emotions, especially affection.

Brown adults, especially brown men, pick up on what I do.
"Oh yeah look at these two. Aha. Oho".

India is westernizing, like most countries. The spectre of homophobia will enslave more men into repressing their emotions.
