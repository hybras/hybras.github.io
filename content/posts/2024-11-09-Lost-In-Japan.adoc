I get lost in groups!{fn-lost-in-japan}
It happens to me all the time.
Its been happening to me since childhood.

I get distracted by something, and boom I'm left behind.

* Grocery Store: nice beans
* Nature hike: cool flower
* Renn faire: artisinal goods

The last time it happened, my friends had my phone lmfao.
Just wandered brownian motion until we found each other.
Still panic every time, gotta get over that.
