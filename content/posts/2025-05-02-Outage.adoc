Went out to a queer (gay) mixer with a friend. 
It was in Arlington, and exclusively older white/asian gay men.
All well-to-do as well, mostly owned their own places (how tf did this topic come up).

I felt very detached from it all, yes mostly do to demographics.
I felt like I putting on a show routine, very similar to Straight Persona.

My apartment building just had an outage.
I noticed the street lamps were off, and the building was dark.
The lobby was full of people.
Many people were walking in the street.

I confirmed it was an outage, just in our building.

I decided to kill time outside.
I considered going to DC, but it was late and I was tired.

I decided to bum around Arlington.
I felt a bit lonely, it being a Friday night and seeing all the clubber out and about.
And all the couples / friends from my building going on walks to kill time.
Lots of presumably single people with their dogs though.
I should care less.

I walked along the main road and found a nice cafe, Three Whistles.
There was a lot of people chilling in and outside.
They had live music, some elderly band doing jazz homages.
I got some coffee and a pastry, both terrible (but on the cheaper side).
Vibes were incredible though, lots of seating, with a dividing wall separating some seats from the music, and some lounge style couch/tables.

The cafe closed at 11. At 10:45, I walked to Virginia Square-ish and back to Three whistles.
I grabbed my bike and headed home.
I wish I hadn't been so sleep-deprived, I would've been able to better enjoy my impromptu outing.
