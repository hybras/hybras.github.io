Me: I'm so tired of grocery shopping. We keep going, but what do we even buy? When will shopping be done?

Bro: Sounds like you need a subscription. Instead of buying bananas, you need a banana subscription. They'll ship it to us

Me: Thats the dream

Bro: And the bananas will have trackers in them so when we eat/peel them, they'll send the next batch. In fact, we'll never need more than one banana at a time.

Me: You just reinvented HP's ink subscription
