summary: I have a mini-breakdown at the thought of never seeing my friends again
---

I graduated a year early, in 2023, so it didn' really hit emotionally for me. Now in May 2024, I'm panicking about never seeing my friends again.

Having written this months after, and with the gift of hindsight, I can see that I will form new friendships, and also boring adulting consumes much of my time and hence cheap socializing is less rewarding / accessible. I've managed with less frequent / higher quality meetups.
