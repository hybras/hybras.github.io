This happened in sometime in Sep - Dec 2021, I don't remember exactly. I was reminded of it by something else.

I was doing office hours for my TA job. I was in a big open area in my school's CS building. I was at the whiteboard explaining something. I felt a tap on my shoulder, it was my friend Russel. He'd come to see me / say hi. He waited a few minutes as I finished up with the current student, we talked, made plans for later.

He took time to come see me. He remembered where I'd be. He surprised me. I felt loved. I love him back. I want to be with him. I'm not sure if my feelings are romantic or platonic.
