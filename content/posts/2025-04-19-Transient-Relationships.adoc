// Kevin Tang
I moved recently, and my previous roomate helped me bring my stuff.
Only lived with him for 6 months.
The kindness feels like I'm taking advantage of him.

// Maitreyee Majumdar
I met my roomate's new girlfriend.
She comes over a lot.
When our lease ends I'll probably never see her again.

// Anna, Kammie Ping, Pramod
I visited friends in Boston, Philly, and Pittsburgh on a lark.
Will I know them in 10 years?
I talk to my Pittsburgh friend like once a year.

// Vishnu Priya Mami
I have extended family in the area.
Visited them through college, up till Dec 2024
Stopped visiting them this year cuz the father and son are both homophobic.

// Shrey, Mayu, Gayathree
I randomly ran into some queer south asian friends from college, my roomate and his girlfriend, and a coworker, all at the mall today.
When will I see them again?
Do I want to?

Those queer south asian friends are homebound, hard to meet up with.

NOTE: This specific paragraph is definitely the depression

Aforementioned Boston and Philly friends came down for the weekend.
Went to the mall w/ them.

// Russel Chiu
One of friends is doing his phd at our undergrad university.
I visit frequently.
Sometimes I catch him. Sometimes not
A couple times he's come out to see me.
Its never enough.
I want more.

// serena zhu, emily desverraux, reagan henke
// abby lane
I think a few of my coworkers on my last and current team are cool.
All cis women.
Probably never going to know them personally.

// Bakr Marouf
Met someone at DC iOS, caught up with them outside work.
Had a good convo about tech + politics, and career  growth.
Will I see him again?
Are we friends? No.
Should we be?

// Ethan nguyen
Met a cool guy at work, invited him to hang with some of my other friends.
We talk about biking and affordability / inequality.
I'd call him a new friend.
He didn't respond to me admittedly last minute text about hanging out today.
Also I wasn't free anyways.
So why do I wish he'd responded?

// Aman, Daphne, Karthik, Rae
I lost a friend group in college, including 4 close friends, in one fell swoop.


== Coda

Stop being depressed dumbass.
You literally wrote this during a break of a whole day of hanging out with some longterm friends.
Immediately after this you belted your heart out with 4 hours of karoake.

Your birthday is in a week go ask people to hangout.
