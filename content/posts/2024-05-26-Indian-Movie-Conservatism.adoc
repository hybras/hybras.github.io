:rara: footnote:rara[what a banger song]

I was rewatching Chandramukhi, because I remembered the song "Ra Ra"{rara}.

== OG Movie Summary

Chandramukhi is a ghost who haunts a mansion that previously belonging to a king. She and her lover were dancers in a king's court. The king kills them both when he realizes she does not reciprocate his (disgusting displays of) affection.

In the present day, Chandramukhi haunts the current residents of the mansion. She seeks revenge (despite her enemies being dead for centuries), and correspondingly possesses a member of the household.

The current inhabitants trick Chandramukhi into thinking she has burned the king alive, and she departs.

== Sequel Summary

== The Rub

This seems to be a common theme with Indian movies, that they're very on the nose and predictable.
A film about casteism will show a low caste citizen displaying superior morals and overcoming discrimination.
A film about religious strife (or forbidden love in general) will show a happy (but initially tumultuous) marriage, or someone exploring different faiths.

At a film's conclusion, unrelated issues ("omens") will also resolve themselves.
The unemployed will find jobs, infertile couples will conceive, spouses will be found for the singles, etc.
