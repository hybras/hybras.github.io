title: Omashu
---

== Adaptation

Adapts "Jet", and "The Northern Air Temple". Wikipedia says "The King of Omashu", is also in here, but I disagree.
Given this, I don't think the title fits.

From hereon, the rushed pacing becomes more obvious. Unlike the first episode, which comprises-ish a story arc, here we have multiple independent storylines. Its a lot.

Azula is introduced ðŸ”¥.

== Pacing

Each MC is assigned one of the above storylines: Aang to "Omashu", Katara to "Jet", and Sokka to "Northern Air Temple".
They team up for the finale.
But in the original episodes they ALL participate in ALL storylines.
A valiant effort is made to merge the story lines, but it wasn't enough to overcome the deluge of plot for me.

== The Northern Air Temple

The temple itself is deleted (and Aang's anger), along with Teo's fellow refugees. Sai's cooperation with the Fire Nation (and the attack on the temple) is reworked into the Jet storyline.

Aang discovers it is Jet who is bombing Omashu, rather than the  spies. In the original episode, Sokka discovers Jet's flooding plan.
This swap is fine, since it preserves Aang and Teo's bonding time.
Really missed the temple though.

We get Sokka nerding out with Mechanist (Sai).
Aang is deceived by Teo's flight (but they don't face-off in the sky).
Interestingly, Sai is Omashu's Chief Engineer.

== Jet

Jet sneaks the Gaang into Omashu, rather than the trio assuming disguises.
// The names they would have used are referred to later on.
Only Katara gets to see Jet's people however.

The Fire Nation official that coerces Sai (and his army) are turned into a network of spies that have infiltrated Omashu.
Jet's crew apprehends the spies, and its implied they are murdered after.
The old man whom jet attacks is deleted.
Instead we learn of Jet's brutal nature, from the spies' murder.

The village Jet tries to destroy is substantially reworked.
Rather than attempting to flood a village occupied by the Fire Nation (killing solders and civilians from both sides), Jet tries to assassinate the Mechanist and the King of Omashu.

In the next episode, Katara apprehends Jet, but I'm filing it here for continuity.

== Cabbages ðŸ¥¬

Technically this _is_ from "King of Omashu".
We see the Cabbage man several times before he finally utters his signature line.

Perfection.

== Zuko and Iroh

Zuko and Iroh infiltrate Omashu to capture Aang.
Zuko and Aang fight.
They are discovered, and Iroh covers Zuko's escape.
Iroh and Aang are captured.

== Azula ðŸ”¥

Azula is introduced.
She informs on a rebel cell that attempts to assassinate Ozai.
We instantly learn of her duplicity and sadism (she watches when Ozai burns the rebels alive).

We also get Tai Lee and Mai's intros, but it is abrupt.
We don't get Azula's trip to collect them from their "boring" lives.
