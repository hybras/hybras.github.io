title: Into the Dark
---

== Adaptation

Aang follows the "King of Omashu" storyline. Iroh follows his minor "captured" storyline from "Winter Solstice", Part 1. Sokka and Katara roughly follow "The Cave of Two Lovers" from season 2.

Technically a continuation of the previous episode, but I'm seperating the two.

== Setup

Aang and Iroh are imprisoned. They have a brief exchange before being sent their seperate ways: Aang to Bumi, and Iroh to Ba Sing Se.

== The King of Omashu

Very similar to the original storyline.

Sokka and Katara are not used as bait for Aang, but the rock candy does make an appearance. Sokka and Katara are plot devices here, so writers get a pass.

Aang immediately recognizes Bumi (boring).
Bumi's challenges are skipped over for the final fight, but there are references (Flopsie statues, etc.)

I was peeved by Aang's airbending feats, but that's because the original airbending doesn't translate to live action.
They tried.

== The Cave of Two lovers

This one is interesting for how much it was modifed while still staying a self contained unit.
I wonder why they reached into season 2 for this, when plenty of season 1 remains.

Rather than the Gaang returning to Omashu so Aang can learn airbending, Sokka and Katara try to use Omashu's tunnels to free Aang from Bumi.

The singing hippies make a cameo.
The focus is on the sibling relationship and their trauma, instead of a polite display of childhood romance.

== Iroh 

Iroh displays a much harder attitude than the corresponding animated storyline.
We see the impact of the war on his Earth Kingdom captors.
