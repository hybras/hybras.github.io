== Adaptation

* "The Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku"
* “The Storm”
* “The Blue Spirit”

The episode is tied to its predecessor ep 5: Aang communes with Roku not only to learn about his duty/destiny, but also how to defeat Koh from the previous episode.

== The Winter Solstice: Avatar Roku

The fire sages are skimped on / nerfed.
We got dialogue from them rather than the friendly sage's narration.
Aang is alone, and he doesn't directly confront the sages.
Aang does not channel Roku (he channeled Kyoshi earlier instead).
When Aang emerges from Roku's chambers, it is June the bounty hunter who's waiting for him, not Zhao's forces.

Roku cracks some jokes.
Seems the past Avatars' personalities have more independence from Aang than in the og show: Roku teases Aang, Kyoshi verbally abuses him, and Roku critiques / references other Avatars.
The familiarity between Roku and Aang is preserved, good touch.
Roku mentioning the liabilities of friendship is amazing foreshadowing.

The "call dropping" transition was abrupt.
Roku's chambers are beautiful, his statue immaculate

Roku advising Aang on Koh is "stolen" from the season finale.
Not sure why the Mother of Spirits was referred too.
World building?

Zhao _does_ intercept Zuko's attempt to capture Aang, but its after the Fire temple.

== The Storm

There is no storm (lmao).
The hook to Zuko's backstory is Zhao taking over command.
I miss Iroh's narration, I think it could've been weaved in and out.
But its not necessary.
The existing cuts to Zuko/Iroh's flashback are pretty good.

Zuko and Ozai actually fight, rather than Zuko submitting.
Its an excellent display of firebending, basically the only one so far.
But its not live action accurate and so I have mixed feelings.

Zuko's lieutenant going "But we're the 41st" was utterly stupid.

== The Blue Spirit

The meat of this storyline was copied nearly verbatim. Just incredible.
It fits the darker, grittier tone the show is going for.

Aang and Zuko using the ladders to escape looked amazing.
The scene of Zuko getting shot was too quick.
Maybe we could've followed the arrow, or the archer could've paused.

Aang and Zuko fraternizing felt strange and out of character  but not forced thankfully.
Zuko was an enemy up to this point, including 5 seconds ago when he threatened Aang's life.

Aang returns to save his friends from Koh, whereas in the original they are sick and he returns from captivity with medicine.

The editing hen Zuko staring at his past self is bad (his current and old appearance dont line up).
