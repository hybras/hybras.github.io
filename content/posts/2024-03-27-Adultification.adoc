It begins.
The fragile grasp for the freedom of youth.

The new has program at my company has launched clubs, largely focused on hobbies / activities.
So exciting right?
Nothing wrong with that.

But we are tired after a day's work.
Many of us commute.
The logisitics of it all are hitting us.

Tuesday I organized my club meeting.
It went well.
Many attended.
We had a vibrant discussion.
But people trickled in as the day went on.

Then we had tennis club.
We were all a little tired.

Today was board games.
We were all eally tired.
It was at the office, so some left early.
Many of us selected games requiring little mental effort.

I want the college campus density back.
But with better urban design: a place for living.
And better apartments (shouldn't be hard for working adults).
