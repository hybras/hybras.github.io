I visited a friend in Pittsburgh recently.
I flew Southern Airways Express, a small airline that exclusively uses single prop planes.

I had a nice layover in Dubois Airport, PA.
They had a very nice restaurant, felt very American.
I left my passport at TSA.

I only noticed that I lost my passport after landing in Pittsburgh.
I cancelled my return flight and booked a bus.
If I had Real ID drivers license, I needn't have used my passport for a local flight.

I called the airline and the airport.
The airport found my passport, and called me.
They sent it back on a return flight from the same airline.
I picked it up from the airline's desk at my local airport.

It was hard to ahold of people and get status updates on my passport.
I called about once every couple days.
Small airport.
Small airline.
I was afraid a lack of communication would result in it being returned to the wrong place.
But strangely, I trusted them to not fuck anything up, or to lose it.

I was really scared that they might report my passport lost (which TSA is supposed to do if they find it).
Then I would have to re-apply for a passport, and figure out how (or if) I could get the application fee waved.
I suppose at a small airport, the line between TSA employee and airport employee is thinner.
Especially under the Trump admin
