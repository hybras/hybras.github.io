I was feeling horny and sad about myself because I'm single.
I was about to masturbate to deal with it.
My brother appeared in my doorway.
He mumbled something nonsensical: "Where is everyone?".
It was midnight, everyone else was asleep!

I realized he was sleepwalking so I put him back to bed.
I tucked him in, closed the blinds, kissed him goodnight.
I don't know why, but I asked if I could join him, and he said yes!
And then I got in next to him.

Its been years since we'd slept together, his warmth and touch felt amazing.
Unfortunately, he wasn't good with sharing space or the blanket so I slept poorly.
I wouldn't trade it for anything.
