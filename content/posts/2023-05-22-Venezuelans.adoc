This is a conversation I had during a DC school trip I had during spring 2022 or fall 2023. My SDU friends, a freshmen and his (latina) girlfriend, are at a museum. We're in an exhibit on infectious diseases? inspired by the covid pandemic?

____
_The gf and I are staring at a case of labeled mosquitoes_

Me: _Points to the case. I notice many of them are from a single country._ _These_ are the venezuelans we need to be keeping out of the country.

Her: _Narrows eyes_ Wait ...

Me: _Heart catches in my chest. How could I have put my foot in my mouth like that_


Her: OOHHH! You almost had me there.
