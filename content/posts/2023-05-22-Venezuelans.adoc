This is a conversation I had during a DC school trip I had during spring 2022 or fall 2023. My SDU friends, a freshmen and his (latina) girlfriend, are at a museum. We're in an exhibit on infectious diseases? inspired by the covid pandemic?

*The gf and I are staring at a case of labeled mosquitoes*
Me: *Points to the case. I notice many of them are from a single country.* *These* are the venezuelans we need to be keeping out of the country.
Her: *Narrows eyes* Wait ...
Me: *Heart catches in my chest. How could I have put my foot in my mouth like that*
Her: OOHHH! You almost had me there.
