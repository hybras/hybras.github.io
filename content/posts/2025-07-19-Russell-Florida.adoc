Russel is one of my best friends.
I Love him a lot.

I've written about him a lot, we've been friends for 4 years at this point.
Since graduating, our conversations have taken on a very negative tone due to job prospects and the economy.
I became a software engineer, him a PhD student in Computer Engineering.
The sacrifices he made to pursue a degree struck me (opportunity cost of lost income, graduate student living conditions, etc).
And on my much more privileged end, I was salty that while I made a lot, I never felt secure (home, kids,partner, employment).

Well today, July 19th 2025 it has all come to a head.

Russel's PhD funding has been cut by Trump.
He will be moving to Florida to be with his girlfriend and find a job.
My best friend.
Gone into the wind.

And as for me, my VP just told me that many of senior engineers find me abrasive, and spoke ill of me during performance management.
I try so hard, to be me, and its not enough.
I see my coworkers making leaps and bounds and I'm left behind.
Again. 
As always.
