summary: My friends and I watched the Geminids meteor shower out of Acadia National park in the dead of winter

I last-minute joined my friends for a hoiday trip.
We flew out of DC to Boston (picking up a friend who moved there for work), and drove up to Acadia Nat'l park.

== Boston

My friends arrived in the morning, and so had a day to explore.
I came in the evening and met up with them.
Right away I noticed the metro (which was fast and freqeunt), didn't provide service across the city, just in/out.
Also, there wasn't a single central station for transfers, the four line intersect as the four sides of a rectangle (transfers at the corners). I needed to trasnfer from one corner to the opposite, and had to walk quite a bit.
I was unable to find a good public spot to wait for my friends.
Thankfully a grocery store, Hmart, had restaurant seating.

We went to a fancy mediterranean restaurant
We ended up taking a pleasure stroll between metro lines and continued onward to our hotel.

== Portland

The next day we drove to Acadia with a stop in Portland, Maine.
A charming medium size city, with decent activity even in the off season.
There was a beautiful visitor center along the waterfront, really appreciated that it was staffed, heated, and large. It was a decen spot to regroup before
We walked along the main street and visited local businesses.

== Acadia

We got takeout from Shinbashi in Ellesworth (suprisingly large town for remote area) and checked into our vacation rental.
We would've preferred to get a hotel room, since AirBnb is apparently destroying afforable housing, but we were a group of 5 and didn't want to pay for 3 rooms.
Hence our rental which fit upto 6, but was priced per person. I wonder what would've happened if we underbooked.

We then drove into the park under cover of dark, to Sandy Beach.
It was surreal seeing the park solely through bright moonlight under a clear sky.
It felt like a horror movie when everything is in black and white, despite the decent visibility.

== The Geminids

The comets were blink-and-you-miss-it.
White pin pricks disappearig after a short streak, not quite the brightness of most stars.
My friend said the moonlight was impeding our view.
