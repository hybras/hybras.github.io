What comes to mind when you think "Karen"?
A middle aged white woman?
Someone making demands of those in service industry?
Using stereotypes to justify reporting minority groups to the police?
Except for not being white, my mom is a dead ringer for the all the other Karen™️ qualifications.
I've always been embarrassed about my mom's behavior in public (lets be honest who _hasn't been embarrassed_ by their family in public?).
But a recent incident 😑 made me rethink whether my mom treats strangers with a similar level of respect to her family.

. Incident @ Cake 🍰 Shop
 .. She highlighted to the stores *2* employees that the sign was not lit up.
In the middle of the day
 .. Then went on to fake a concern that other people might not know if the store was open, and listed _every other store on the block that had their signs lit_, which wasn't even all of them (cherry-picking mom?).
. Whenever we go out to eat
 .. She always orders _warm_ water.
No problems there.
 .. On the off chance the waiter serves room temp water my mom will glare 😠 at the waiter, refuse to drink it, and demands it be warmed.
 .. Ditto for minor mistakes in food delivery / groceries.
  ... Once we ordered red apples, and green ones were sent instead.
Mind you, the apples were fine.
My mother got a food refund after admonishing the business owner.
. Incident with a 🖌 painter
 .. Mom wanted the house painted
 .. She selected a set of colors that were hard to distinguish
 .. She complained that the painter was using the wrong color many times
 .. Halfway through, she switched colors, claiming that our kitchen needed a lighter one because it recieved more light.
The color she picked was almost identical to a color the painter had made by mixing white and the previously picked color.
