I went to Lesbians who Tech this year (post forthcoming).
During https://lesbianswhotech.org/about/leanne-pittsford/[the Founder's] speech, she mentioned how it was becoming harder for conferences to find sponsors, especially diversity initiatives.
She also told us that the seed money for the conference was her brother's life insurance money (he died young, )

A few days ago I learnt about XOXO conference, and was watching their recorded talks on youtube.
While googling, I noticed this year's conference was marked as the final one.
I found articles about the founders' being burnt out, struggling with sponsors, and never wanting to be forever.

Ive had Strange Loop conference talks in my backlog for months now. I noticed their website's https cert had expired.
I googled, https://web.archive.org/web/20241019230003/https://www.thestrangeloop.com/index.html[same thing].
https://web.archive.org/web/20241109210000/https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/112bnl6/why_is_strangeloop_the_conference_ending/[Founder burnout], reduced attendance, funding issues.

I hope this isn't a trend.
I found the posted content so hopeful, inspiring, enriching, and stimulating.
