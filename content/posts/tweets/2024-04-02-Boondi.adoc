I was munching on some https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boondi[boondi] when I realized that the spicy/salty version is basically the same of cheetos / doritos.

I've hated the O's since forever, and maybe looked down on people who like them ("he licked cheeto dust of his fingers before typing"). The realization came as I was lcking boondi dust off my fingers.

Perhaps an American rebranding to Boondos :tm: is needed.
