This year I went to https://web.archive.org/web/20240928210248/https://lesbianswhotech.org/newyorksummit2024/[Lesbians Who Tech]!
Which is exactly what it sounds like: a tech conference that centers the experiences of women and (nb) people in tech! (But not gay men woohoo)!

While I'm not the target demographic, I figure I'm close enough.
I asked my manager for permission (super awkward) and got it!

== Topics Breakdown

Talks seemed to roughly follow 4 categories:

* Generative AI
** Boeing: Create flight plans and airport schedules

* "Regular" AI and data science
** Lots of talks from healthcare companies tailoring treatment or automating diagnoses

* Social Justice
** Parental (Maternal) Leave
** Combatting Performative Inclusion
