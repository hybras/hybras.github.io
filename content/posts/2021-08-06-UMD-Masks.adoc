____
My university announced that masks are required again as the delta variant of covid 19 spreads in the US.

https://web.archive.org/web/20210807003540/https://umd.edu/covid-19-dashboard[UMD's overall vaccination rate is ~85%, and ~95% for those on campus].

I'm so frustrated with my country right now.
I want the fucking FBI to roll out in their vans and start darting people with the vaccine (a useless fantasy).
I gave up a year of my life, like so many Americans.
I'm tired

Other countries never had outbreaks or managed to contain them.
China welded people's doors shut to keep them home.
I look around and see plenty of people who never had to give up anything for nearly as long as I did.
I'm jealous.

Call them whatever.
Republicans, conservatives, evangelicals, conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers.
The words have meanings, but they doesn't matter.
Anti-vaxxers are ruining it for all of us.
I'm angry.

My university is _so damn close_ to being 100% vaccinated.
We're among the least likely to get ill.
But we try to be good.
If I infected someone's granny I'd never forgive myself.
But between me and that granny there's half the country not giving a shit.

I will comply will PG County's laws.
But the urge to be a self centered asshole like ~stem:[\frac{1}{2}] of my country grows stronger.
Why should I reward their behavior by protecting them?
