We were returning from a school trip.
We were split across three white vans, driven by the Adults™️: the director D, assistant director A, and a grad student G assigned to our program.
For whatever reason, our director drove aggressively and left our "caravan" (is it a caravan when its only 2 vans?).

At some point, G became very nervous about driving.
Strangely, I don't remember if I was in the van driven by G or by A.
Pretty sure I was with A since I remember talking with her while driving, but this might not have been from our return.
I remember people in the 2 vans texting and calling each other as the situation began.
Pretty quickly we stopped. I believe we were still in West Virginia at the time. We managed to find a spot to pull over, no small feat since this was a narrow road alongside mountains.

We were all trying to figure out what happened.
G was white as a sheet and stuttering.
We waited for them to recover, but they didn't calm down enough.
Ideas about how to proceed were haphazardly thrown around.
Someone suggested coffee, another mentioned music.
I think most of us realized that we were already in a very relaxing situation (a leisurely mountain drive with incredible scenery).
I ¿think? we had a false start.

Eventually, A started going round asking us if any of us could drive.
D had mentioned it earlier, apparently peeved that we were dawdling over a trivial matter.
A was concerned about liability, and you know ...  a young adult driving a large vehicle packed to the brim with people.
I was asked, since I had a permit (not my full license) and was one of the eldest students.
Unfortunately, I declined.
A freshmen eventually volunteered.
She definitely was the calmest amongst those asked.

She drove us back safely.
It was a few hours and we all rejoiced upon returning to the dorm.

In retrospect, I could've volunteered to drive since we were taking it slowly.
Or we could've taken turns.
