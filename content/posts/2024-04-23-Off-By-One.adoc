:fn-justin: footnote:justin[A really good lecturer in math/cs at UMD. Very friendly and a good teacher]

The semester I took crypto, Spring '23, https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/[Justin] also taught it.
So for fun I would sit in his section every so often (my friend Oliver got in and I as jealous).

Towards the end of semester, attendance dropped off so one day I came and there were about a dozen students out of ~80.
This might've also been after an exam, and people often skip the next day to recover.

Justin jokingly said those in attendance would get extra credit on the next assignment.

I then outed myself as a student from another section, and informed him he'd have to amend his count.
Tragic.
