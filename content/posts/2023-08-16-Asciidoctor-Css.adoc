Asciidoctor implements a rich markup language with a nice syntax. I use it for notes, my website, and lecture materials.

Unfortunately, its rich feature set https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/html-backend/default-stylesheet/#why-provide-a-default[requires ccs support]. The https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/blob/v2.0.19/src/stylesheets/asciidoctor.css[default style sheet] is several thousand lines and ~35kb before compression / minification. This presents a significant challenge when creating a minimal theme.

I came across the https://github.com/darshandsoni/asciidoctor-skins[Asciidoctor Skins] project, and https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory/[Stylesheet Factory]. Both provide a selection of themes that override parts of the default theme using standard tricks (variables, imports, rule precedence).

The default stylesheet bears no comments, which would be helpful to understand which rules are cosmetic, add functionality, or improve cross browser compatibility.

I don't want https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/html-backend/default-stylesheet/#disable-or-modify-the-web-fonts[fonts], or https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/html-backend/local-font-awesome/[font awesome icons] (though they really are awesome). I'm not worried about ancient or minimal browsers (mobile and desktop is enough headache).
