Copy pasted statement. Please do not reshare.

TLDR: I'm being fired and probably moving home in a few months.

On Friday July 25, 2025, I received a negative performance rating and associated “coaching plan” to improve my performance. I am now writing this on Tuesday July 29th after having a few days to process. Despite this not being a final notice, I consider it as such. Even if I do pass my coaching plan, it is no guarantee of future safety. 

## Personal angle

The personal cost to me will be great. I've organized my life to a significant extent around this company, including my social circles, volunteering, housing, and family interactions.

My best friend of moving away, as is my aunt. Having all this happen at once has been difficult.

I believe I'm being tacitly and mildly discriminated against for being neurodivergent and queer. That's life.

## Next steps from me

I will take this time (the remainder of the calendar year) to job hunt. In the likely event that I neither find anything nor pass my coaching plan, I will move back in with my parents. I'm thinking about doing my masters.

## Next steps from ya'll

I'd appreciate staying in touch. Keep reaching out, and I'll do the same. It'll probably be difficult once/if I move, but I'll do my best. 

If anyone knows any open positions, especially in the DMV/NoVA area, please forward them to me. I'd also love any recommendations if possible.

And last but not least, keep living your best lives, because hearing your successes warms my heart.
