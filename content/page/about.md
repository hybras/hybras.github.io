I'm Varun Chari, a [CS major](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) @ [UMD](https://www.umd.edu), class of 2024. I also happen to be in the [Scholar's living and learning program](https://scholars.umd.edu), under [Science ü•º, Discovery üîç & the Universe üåå](https://scholars.umd.edu/programs/sdu).

I love learning new programming languages and math. I read in my free time, though there hasn't been [much of that lately](https://weheartit.com/entry/164749997).

Feel free to call me `hybras`, It's my 2nd name at this point. In the [Artemis Fowl bookseries, by Eoin Colfer](https://www.eoincolfer.com/artemis-fowl), the island of Hybras is the home of demons, exiled from the timeline. I guess I just liked the name (I don't really know, I began using the name years after reading the books).

As for my pfp, I chanced upon it while searching for Star Wars iconography. I don't know where it comes from, and [Google Image search](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&tbs=simg:CAQSlQIJlf6WlyZj2UcaiQILELCMpwgaYApeCAMSJt8B6gHyAUaDCT3zAecB_1QPjAZUpuj-iNKQ04ymuNKs06y2wOsQtGjDPIt621ljMKGep7pWnIG9IWOTCw6Kt_12ZbLrEqFcYYuxeyQ024OeFQnbftvEmN7gogBAwLEI6u_1ggaCgoICAESBG-s--oMCxCd7cEJGoMBChkKBmVtYmxlbdqliPYDCwoJL20vMDF3azljChgKBmNpcmNsZdqliPYDCgoIL20vMDF2a2wKFgoEd29vZNqliPYDCgoIL20vMDgzdnQKGAoGd2VhcG9u2qWI9gMKCggvbS8wODNrYgoaCghzeW1tZXRyedqliPYDCgoIL20vMGYyOG0M&q=jedi+logo&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6pLrKuYrsAhXSmuAKHUl4D2oQ2A4oAXoECBAQKQ&biw=1536&bih=760#imgrc=WeenJJ8BQ30jvM) (beware long link) hasn't been helpful in pinning it down.
